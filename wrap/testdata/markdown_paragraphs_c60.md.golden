This is a short paragraph that fits within the column width.

This is a much longer paragraph that should definitely be
rewrapped because it exceeds the sixty character column
width limit that we have set for this particular test case.

Short line.

Another very long paragraph with lots of words that keeps
going and going and going until it well exceeds the column
width boundary we established.
